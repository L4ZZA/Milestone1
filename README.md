<b>Marking Criteria</b><br>
You	must	submit	a	modified	version	of	the	game	that compiles,	and	contains	the	features	below.	In	
assessment,	all	five	features	carry	equal	weight.
<ul>
<li>The	game	should	contain	instances	of	at least	two	new	body	classes	(subclasses	
of DynamicBody) significantly	different	from	each	other	and	from	those	distributed. More	
than	two	new	body	classes	(up	to	a	maximum	of	four)	will	gain	higher	marks.</li>
<li>Instances	of	at	least	one	of	your	new	body	classes	should	be	rendered	with	images.	Body	
shapes	do	not	have	to	align	exactly	with	images	but	they	should	align	sufficiently	well	that	
the	look	and	feel	of	the	game	is	not	compromised. Wider	and/or	more	effective	use	of	
images	to	render	bodies	will	gain	higher	marks.</li>
<li>At	least	one	of	your	new	body	classes	should	have	at	least	one	additional	attribute	with	
appropriate	accessor	and	mutator	methods.		Wider	use	of	additional	body	attributes	will	
gain	higher	marks.</li>
<li>The	game	should	be	controllable	with	either	the	keyboard	or	mouse	(or	both). More	
sophisticated	controls	will	gain	higher	marks.</li>
<li>Your	game	should	respond	to	certain	collisions	between	bodies	by	changing	the	values of	
the	additional	attributes mentioned	above.	Add	print	statements	to	your	collision	handlers	
so	that	the	changes	can	be	seen	to	be	happening. Wider	use	of	collision	handling	will	gain	
higher	marks.</li>
</ul>

<b>Task</b><br>
